This isnt using any Front end framework,
it is simble and basic chat app created for real time server demonstration purpose,
to run this locally u can just run 'node index.js',
before make sure to install requirements with 'npm install'
this is using sqlite (sqlite3) database (used it cause the app is light-weight),
if you want to see how it looks you can visit `https://socketiochat-ffq5.onrender.com/`(Used Render to Deploy and serve it)
